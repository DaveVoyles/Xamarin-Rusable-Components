Small widgets to create a dynamic UI based on a config file
----------
### About
This was created as part of a Xamarin hackfest hosted by Microsoft in NYC on the week of November 28th. 

The idea is to create small UI components in C#, which then generate XAML. Right now there are two days of doing this in the project:

1. Pass in some hardcoded values *(font sizes, image url, etc.)*
2. Make a web request to an API and pull down data, and pass that data as paramters to these C# components

----------
### How to use
1. Pull down the [Restsharp NuGet package](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp)
2. Run the project

I've tested this on iOS and Android and both work fine.
